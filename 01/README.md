# URL Snake

Play the classic snake game on a URL!

This is how the game should look:

The game *might* be playable on some mobile devices (it should show on-screen controls on them), but the mobile browsers i tried seem to like hiding the path and fragment parts of the URL, or not refreshing it at all, rendering the game unplayable. Please let me know if the game works for you on mobileâ€”or if it doesn't but you have an idea on how to fix it :)

Although the game is kind of a joke, bug reports, ideas and pull requests are [super welcomed](https://github.com/epidemian/snake/issues).
